Fluid-Simulation-DirectX11
==========================

Codebase for my Honours Project: Adaptive Fluid Simulation using DirectX 11

This will feature different experiments of simulating fluid mechanics in a 2D or 3D environment and seeing how to algorithms
can be adapted to be used in Real-time. As the project progresses so will this description. Changelog so far:

v1.0.0: Initial working version of 2D Fluid Simulation with small interactivity.
